			<h3>Site Proposed Intent</h3>
		</div>
		<p class="introduction">A</p><p>fter much discovery and industry research it has been determined that this website falls well short of current website standards. These defencies include, but are not limited to, over 100 HTML validation errors according to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="blank">W3C Markup Validation Service.</a> No CSS errors were reported becasue the site uses little if any current HTML5/CSS best practices in it's markup. The site severely lacks in the area of Information Architecture with difficult Navigation &amp; Usability. The lack of an Escape Hatch only added to the frustration of users while trying to understand the sites message. This website also gains zero recognition in search results on various search engines using the sites own "Keywords" as recognized by <a href="https://adwords.google.com" target="blank">Google AdWords.</a></p>
		<hr>
		<p>The Intent of rebuilding this website would be primarily focused on promoting thier Custom Vinyl &amp; Graphic Design Services with e-Commerce capabilities. Before completely making over the websites Visual Hierarchy &amp; Navigation components, a thorough "Keyword Research" &amp; SEO plan must be implimented. While this document does not list all of the possible search terms &amp; phrases most commonly associated with your industry, it is clear that much improvement is needed. Attracting more online clients using both common, high trafic keywords combined with some custom targeting of certain demographics should generate a, yet-to-be-determined, but substantial increase in online markting ROI.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Ease of Navigation will be a priority based on the unique &amp; diverse products &amp; services offered. By consolidating services, products, sponserships and parnters information, users will be able to find what they are looking for faster &amp; easier resulting in a better user experience, more return busines and more referals. Finally the website would be built to (W3C) <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="blank">World Wide Web Consortium</a> standards using the latest HTML5/CSS practicies. This will ensure that your website reflects industry design standards and branding. It will also improve the Visual Heiarchy keeping site visitors on page longer, visiting more pages, and enjoying the User Experience. Most importantly it will ensure that your site can be modified and kept up-to-date with design and programming best practices all the while keeping Mobile First and Browser Compatability at a premium.</p>
